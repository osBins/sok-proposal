## Abstract
Arianna is an EPUB reader application started by Niccol√≤ Venerandi and Carl Schwan in December 2022. It is built using QtWebEngine and epub.js. The aim is to create a fully functional EPUB reader with features such as 
* Support different formats such as EPUB, PDF, TXT
* Highlighting text
* Creating a library
* Fast loading times
* Modern UI experience  
etc.

## Motivation
I was a KDE Plasma user for a long time and I have always liked the KDE philosophy "Simple by default, powerful when needed".  

There is a lot of appreciation for KDE applications like Kdenlive and Krita by people around me who are familiar with the KDE ecosystem, and being able to contribute to it by working on an EPUB reader for KDE is an exciting prospect for me.  

I would enjoy contributing to KDE's ecosystem and help us get closer to our long-term accessibility goal "KDE For All".  
Being a part of the communication channels and having solved a few issues for the KDE websites (`kde-org`, `plasma-bigscreen-org` and the `aether-theme`) already with Carl Schwan and Phu Ngyuen, I like how positive and helpful people in this organization are. It would be a great learning opportunity for me as I contribute to KDE.


## SoK'23 Objectives
Since this project is in it's early stages right now, we can focus on implementing core functionality. For SoK'23, I would like to implement the features -  

| S. No. | Features |
| ------ | -------- |
| 1 | Make the EPUB reader application `inherit Plasma system theme` |
| 2 | `Add reader settings`, allowing users to change font size, reader layout, switching between light and dark theme, line width, line spacing etc. |
| 3| `Add a table of contents` for the EPUBs |

## Additional Information & Details
<table>
<tr> <td> Inherit Plasma theme </td> <td> This can be achieved by using JavaScript as QT applications can pick Plasma theme colors by default </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> Add reader settings </td> <td> Since these options are already configurable using the backend, we create a page to display settings to configure these through UI using QML and JS </td> </tr>

<tr> <td> Add table of contents </td> <td> This can be implemented using the QAbstractListModel class since our use case contains one dimensional list </td> </tr>
</table>

Apart from these milestones, I will fix/maintain code whenever required.

## Other Commitments
I am an undergraduate student and have my university classes and project work during my semester. I will be able to give 15-25 hours per week to SoK.
* I have my first cycle of exams from 20 - 25 February 2023
* Second cycle of exams from 5 - 10 April 2023

I will not be able to work in full capacity during that time (during 5th and 11th week).
